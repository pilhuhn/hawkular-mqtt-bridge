= hawkular-mqtt-bridge

A Ruby Hawkular Client, that accepts data via MQTT and forwards it into Hawkular.
It does this by using the Hawkular-client-Ruby gem.


image::bridge_arch.png[Architecture overview]

The bridge registers with the MQTT broker and listens on `/hawkular/+` topics.
Metric arriving on `/hawkular/metrics` are forwarded as such and registration
messages on `/hawkular/register` are used to register the external resource
like an ESP8622 micro controler with a thermo sensor are added to the Hawkular
inventory.

Future versions of the bridge will also be able to set up alerts.

== Registration messages

The following is an example registration message:

[source,json]

== Example client

In `examples/esp8266/lua` you will find a LUA script that
you can upload to e.g. an https://www.adafruit.com/products/2471[Adafruit Huzzah ESP]

You should update the firmware to something much newer
than 0.9.5 that the Huzzah comes with.
Client code needs the cjson, mqtt,net,node,ow,tmr and wifi modules
